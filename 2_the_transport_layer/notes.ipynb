    "\n",
    "### TCP Connections\n",
    "\n",
    "- TCP is a **connection-oriented** protocol. **It doesn't start sending application data until a connection has been established between application processes**.\n",
    "- In order to establish a connection, TCP uses what is known as a **Three-way Handshake**\n",
    "    - This is where the `SYN` and `ACK` flags come into play.\n",
    "    -  The `FIN` flag is used in a different process, the **Four-way Handshake**, used for terminating connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"transport-tcp-thre-way-handshake.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the above process, the following happens:\n",
    "    - The sender sends a SYN message (a TCP Segment with the SYN flag set to 1)\n",
    "    - Upon receiving this SYN message, the receiver sends back a SYN ACK message (a TCP Segment with the SYN and ACK flags set to 1)\n",
    "    - Upon receiving the SYN ACK, the sender then sends an ACK (a TCP Segment with the ACK flag set to 1)\n",
    "- Upon sending the ACK, the sender can immediately start sending application data. \n",
    "- The receiver must wait until it has received the ACK before it can send any data back to the sender. \n",
    "- One of the main reasons for this process is to synchronise (SYN) the sequence numbers that will be used during the connection.<br><br>\n",
    "- Part of the purpose of these flags was to manage the connection state\n",
    "- **Three-way Handshake to Establish a Connection, with Connection States**\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"three-way-handshake.png\" width=750>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A key characteristic of the process is that the sender cannot send any application data until after it has sent the ACK Segment.**\n",
    "- What this means in practical terms, is that **there is an entire round-trip of latency before any application data can be exchanged**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Flow Control\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flow control** is a mechanism to prevent the sender from overwhelming the receiver with too much data at once. \n",
    "- The receiver will only be able to process a certain amount of data in a particular time-frame. \n",
    "- Data awaiting processing is stored in a **'buffer'**. The buffer size will depend on the amount of memory allocated according to the configuration of the OS and the physical resources available.\n",
    "- Each side of a connection can let the other side know the amount of data that it is willing to accept via the WINDOW field of the TCP header. \n",
    "- Although flow control prevents the sender from overwhelming the receiver, it doesn't prevent either the sender or receiver from overwhelming the underlying network. For that task we need a different mechanism: **Congestion Avoidance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Congestion Avoidance\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Network Congestion** is a situation that occurs when there is more data being transmitted on the network than there is network capacity to process and transmit the data. \n",
    "- Routers use a 'buffer' to store data that is awaiting processing, but if there is more data to be processed than can fit in the buffer, the buffer over-flows and those data packets are dropped.\n",
    "- TCP retransmits lost data. If lots of data is lost that means lots of retransmitted data, which is inefficient. \n",
    "- TCP actually uses data loss as a feedback mechanism to detect, and avoid, network congestion; if lots of retransmissions are occurring, TCP takes this as a sign that the network is congested and reduces the size of the transmission window.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages of TCP\n",
    "\n",
    "- In addition to a latency overhead, another potential issue with using TCP is Head-of-Line (HOL) blocking.\n",
    "- **Head-of-Line (HOL) blocking** relates to how issues in delivering or processing one message in a sequence of messages can delay or 'block' the delivery or processing of the subsequent messages in the sequence.\n",
    "- HOL blocking can occur as a result of the fact that TCP provides for in-order delivery of segments. If one of the segments goes missing and needs to be retransmitted, the segments that come after it in the sequence can't be processed, and need to be buffered until the retransmission has occurred. \n",
    "- This can lead to increased queuing delay which is one of the elements of latency."

    "    - The lack of acknowledgements and retransmissions means that the actual data delivery itself is **faster**\n",
    "- An example of such an application would be a voice or video calling application. The occasional piece of dropped data leading to a slightly glitchy call or a few pixels of video not rendering properly is worth the trade off of the speed provided by the protocol which allows the application to work even over long distances where there is high latency."
