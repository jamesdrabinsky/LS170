    "- **Focus on HTTP**: The focus of this lesson is still very much HTTP, and how it enables network communication between a client and a server.\n",
    "- **HTTP is concerned with the structure of messages**: HTTP is a set of rules concerned with the syntax and structure of messages exchanged between applications. \n",
    "    - Working with HTTP is ultimately about understanding what those rules mean, and knowing how and when to apply them.\n",
    "- **HTTP is a Request-Response protocol**: One of the fundamental aspects of HTTP is its Request-Response behavior."

    "- `GET /`: request the homepage\n",
    "- `HTTP/1.0 200 OK`: response code and status.  `HTTP 1.0` is the version of http that the server is using.\n",
    "- The information below are headers; a set of metadata that contains additional information about the response that doesn't actually go in the response body itself.\n",
    "    - The `Content-Type` header is required most of the time and tells the browser or whatever the client is how to interpret the body of the response.  A browser will display the response visually.\n",

    "## Speaking the Same Language\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the video from the previous assignment, the request that we sent to `google.com` was very simple: `GET /`\n",
    "- The server at `google.com` was able to interpret this as an HTTP request because the request followed certain syntactical rules, and the server was familiar with those rules. \n",
    "- The client making the request and the server receiving the request can speak the same language, and so are able to communicate.<br><br>\n",
    "- There have been a number of different versions of HTTP since its inception, and each of those versions have slightly different rules.\n",
    "- The structure of the request line we used for our request `GET /` follows the syntactical rules for HTTP 0.9 which only required the method and path in the request line.\n",
    "- The response itself is formatted according to HTTP 1.0 syntax since it includes headers.<br><br>\n",
    "- When making a request to `launchschool.com`, be sure to specify the HTTP version or the server may not respond: `GET / HTTP/1.1`.  This is because the web server does not support unspecified HTTP versions.\n",
    "- The reponse looks like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\n",
    "Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store\n",
    "Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\n",

    "```\n",
    "- 4xx level response codes indicate an error or issue on the client side, i.e. with the request. \n",
    "- A `400` error is a general indication that there is a problem with the structure of the request; in other words the server did not understand the request due to its syntax. \n",
    "- This is basically the server saying to the client 'I don't understand what you just asked me'.<br><br>\n",
    "- In versions of HTTP subsequent to 0.9, the request line must include the HTTP version, and so the server at `launchschool.com` is expecting this to be included in the request: `GET / HTTP/0.9`\n",
    "- The response will look like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "HTTP/1.1 505 HTTP Version Not Supported\n",

    "Content-Length: 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "- 5xx level response codes indicate an error or issue on server side. This time the request was valid, and the server was able to understand it, but it replies to the client that it cannot communicate using the version of HTTP that the client wants to use.<br><br>\n",
    "- Using a different HTTP version that the server should support: `GET / HTTP/1.1`\n",
    "- We still get a `400` response.\n",
    "- The specification for HTTP 1.1 states: `A client MUST send a Host header field in all HTTP/1.1 request messages.`\n",
    "- Because we have specified that we want to use HTTP 1.1, the server is expecting a `Host` header in the request:\n",
    "```\n",
    "GET / HTTP/1.1\n",
    "Host: launchschool.com\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- We get a `301 Move Permanently` response code.\n",
    "- Unlike 4xx and 5xx response codes, 3xx codes don't indicate an error. Instead they are generally used in relation to redirection, and indicate to the client that it must take some additional action in order to complete the request. \n",
    "- In this case, the server is set up to redirect all `http` requests to `https`. \n",
    "- The response includes a `Location` header which tells the client where it can now find the resource it originally requested. \n",
    "- If the client were a browser, rather than a terminal window using `telnet`, it would automatically issue a new request to the location indicated in the Location header. \n",
    "-  Rather than closing the TCP connection the server sets it to `keep-alive`; it does this since it is expecting another HTTP request from the client as a result of the `301` response."
