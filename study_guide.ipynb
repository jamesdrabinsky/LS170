    "    - **Propagation delay**: this is the amount of time it takes for a message to travel from the sender to the receiver, and can be calculated as the ratio between distance and speed.\n",
    "    - **Transmission delay**: the amount of time it takes to push the data onto the \"link\" or \"node\" in the overall network\n",
    "    - **Processing delay**: Data travelling across the physical network doesn't directly cross from one link to another, but is processed in various ways; amount of time it takes to process the data within one of the \"nodes\" or \"links\" in the overall network.\n",
    "    - **Queuing delay**: The amount of time the data is waiting in the queue or \"buffer\" to be processed is the queuing delay.\n",
    "- The total latency between two points, such as a client and a server, is the sum of all these delays (usually given in milliseconds (ms)), plus any of the following delays:\n",
    "    - **Last-mile latency**: a \"slowing down\" that takes place at the network edge, as smaller and more frequent hops take place as data moves lower in the network hierarchy\n",

    "\n",
    "- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a **connection-oriented protocol** that ensures reliable data transfer between applications on top of the unreliable channel of the lower-layer protocols.\n",
    "    - A connection-oriented system: instantiates new socket object to establish a dedicated virtual connection channel between two processes running on separate devices.\n",
    "    - Doesn't start sending application data until a connection has been established between application processes\n",
    "    - You could have a socket object defined by the host IP and process port, just as in the connectionless system, also using a listen() method to wait for incoming messages\n",
    "    - When new communication comes into the first listening socket, a new socket is created.   This new socket object wouldn't just be defined by the local IP and port number, but also by the IP and port of the process/host which sent the message. \n",
    "    - This socket listens specifically for messages that match its four-tuple, i.e. the IP and port of sender along with the IP and port of the receiver.\n",
    "    - Implementing communication in this way effectively creates a dedicated virtual connection for communication between a specific process running on one host and a specific process running on another host. \n",
    "    - The advantage of having a dedicated connection like this is that it more easily allows you to put in place rules for managing the communication such as the order of messages, acknowledgements that messages had been received, retransmission of messages that weren't received, and so on.\n",
    "- It provides **multiplexing** services\n",
    "    - In the context of a communication network, multiplexing is the idea of transmitting multiple signals over a single channel, such as a single device communicating with the browser, the e-mail client, and streaming Spotify all through the same Network connection.\n",
    "    - Multiplexing is enabled through the use of network ports (port numbers) alongside IP addresses\n",
    "    - This is important because often there are multiple applications running on a single device, and yet IP addresses only provide a ***single channel***.\n",
    "    - Each specific process is assigned a single port, which can be used to identify that same process running on a different device.\n",
    "    - An IP address and port number combined define a communication end-point known as a network socket.\n",
    "    - These sockets allow both IP and the protocol operating at the Transport Layer to transmit data between devices and processes.\n",
    "- The purpose of these types of additional communication rules is to add more **reliability to the communication or Network reliability**.\n",
    "    - Network Reliability ensures that a reliable communication channel is established between processes.\n",
    "    - That is, that all transmitted data is received at communication end-point in the correct order.\n",
    "    - Consists of 4 key elements:\n",
    "        - **In-order delivery**: data is received in the order that it was sent\n",
    "        - **Error detection**: corrupt data is identified using a checksum\n",
    "        - **Handling data loss**: missing data is retransmitted based on acknowledgements and timeouts\n",
    "        - **Handling duplication**: duplicate data is eliminated through the use of sequence numbers\n",
    "    - Network reliability is implemented by TCP in the Transport Layer.\n",
    "    - Lower level protocols (Ethernet and the Internet Protocols) are inherently unreliable; they include checksum data as part of their header or trailer so that the data transported as frames and packets can be tested to ensure it hasn't become corrupt during its journey. \n",
    "    - If the data is corrupt however, these protocols simply discard it (dropping the frame or packet); there is no provision within these protocols for enabling the replacement of lost data. The possibility of losing data and it not being replaced means that the network up to and including the Internet Protocol is effectively an unreliable communication channel.\n",
    "- **Segments** are the Protocol Data Unit (PDU) of TCP. Like the PDUs of protocols we've looked at for other network layers, it uses a combination of headers and payload to provide encapsulation of data from the layer above.\n",
    "    - The Source and Destination port numbers are fields in the segment header, while data such as an HTTP request is part of the payload.\n",
    "    - It provides five main services:\n",
    "        - **Multiplexing** through source and destination port numbers\n",
    "        - **Error detection** through a checksum\n",
    "        - **In-order deliver, handling data loss, and handling data duplication (data reliability)** through sequence and acknowledgment numbers\n",
    "        - **Flow control** through window size data\n",
    "        - **Congestion avoidance** through dynamic adjustment of flow according to data loss\n",
    "- The **main downsides of TCP** are the latency overhead of establishing a connection, and the potential Head-of-line blocking as a result of in-order delivery.\n",
    "    - TCP provides reliability at the cost of speed (that is, its reliability functions can contribute greatly to latency)\n",
    "    -  The added overhead due to the need of establishing a connection with the three-way handshake, which can add up to two round trip times.\n",
    "    - **Head-of-Line (HOL) blocking** relates to how issues in delivering or processing one message in a sequence of messages can delay or 'block' the delivery or processing of the subsequent messages in the sequence.\n",
    "        - HOL blocking can occur as a result of the fact that TCP provides for in-order delivery of segments. If one of the segments goes missing and needs to be retransmitted, the segments that come after it in the sequence can't be processed, and need to be buffered until the retransmission has occurred.\n",
    "        - This can lead to increased queuing delay which is one of the elements of latency.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**UDP**\n",
    "\n",
    "- User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a very simple protocol compared to TCP. It provides multiplexing (through source and destination port numbers) and ***optional*** error detection (through checksum), but no reliability, no in-order delivery, and no congestion or flow control.\n",
    "- It establishes end-to-end connections between processes in the Transport Layer.\n",
    "- UDP is **connectionless**, and so doesn't need to establish a connection before it starts sending data\\\n",
    "    - A connectionless system relies on a single socket for all communication, does not establish dedicated communication channels, and responds to all communications individually as they arrive.\n",
    "    - One socket object defined by the IP address of the host machine and the port assigned to a particular process running on that machine.\n",
    "    - That object could call a `listen()` method which would allow it to wait for incoming messages directed to that particular IP/port pair.\n",
    "    - It would simply process any incoming messages as they arrived and send any responses as necessary.\n",
    "    - It does not matter from what process transmissions come, a single socket listens to all messages regardless and responds to each as it arrives.\n",
    "    - This is useful because it is a) a simpler and more flexible process than a connection-oriented system and b) it reduces latency overhead because a connection does not have to be established.\n",
    "- Specifically, UDP provides speed because it doesn't take the time to establish a dedicated connection, its lack of in-order delivery means no latency due to Head-of-Line blocking, and the one way data flow of a connectionless system cuts down on latency due to extra round trips (there are no acknowledgments), and since it is a connectionless protocol, it provides no connection state tracking,\n",
    "- Furthermore, UDP acts as a \"base template\" that programmers can build upon. The specifics of what type of reliability functions to include are left up to the developer to implement at the Application level.\n",
    "- UDP does not provide any of the reliability of TCP. It is just as inherently unreliable as the layers below it.\n",
    "- With UDP there is no guarantee of message delivery, delivery order, congestion avoidance, flow control, or state tracking.\n",
    "- For example, video calling applications and online games that prioritize speed and low latency/lag over the potential for small amounts of lost data, can utilize UDP."

    "**Flow Congestion**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flow congestion is a mechanism to prevent the sender from overwhelming the receiver with too much data at once.\n",
    "- Provided by TCP, flow control helps to ensure that data is transmitted as efficiently as possible.\n",
    "- This, in turn, helps to mitigate the increased latency inherent in TCP connections.\n",
    "- It is implemented via the window field of the TCP segment header.\n",
    "    - The window header field contains data sent by the receiver letting the sender know the maximum amount of data it can accept at any given time.\n",
    "    - This number is dynamically generated, and therefore the receiver can lower the amount if the buffer is getting full, and the sender will respond accordingly.\n",
    "    - Data awaiting processing is stored in a **'buffer'**. The buffer size will depend on the amount of memory allocated according to the configuration of the OS and the physical resources available.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Congestion Avoidance**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Congestion avoidance is a service provided by TCP that attempts to prevent network congestion, a situation in which more data is being transmitted than there is capacity.\n",
    "- To implement this, TCP uses data loss as a feedback mechanism to determine how \"congested\" the network is, by tracking how many retransmissions are required.\n",
    "- A lot of data loss, or a lot of retransmissions, indicates there is more data on the network than there is capacity to process that data.\n",
    "- TCP will take this as a sign to reduce the size of the transmission window, that is, it will send less data along the given channel.\n",
    "- This is done to make data transmission as efficient as possible to mitigate the latency overhead inherent in TCP connections."

    "If the resource in question is a home page, the path might consist of a single forward slash (/).\n",
    "Historically, the path has indicated specifically where the resource was located on the server, but with the proliferation of dynamically generated content, this no longer always follows the absolute file path of the server.\n",

    "Because query strings are passed in through the URL, they are only used in HTTP GET requests.\n",
    "Query strings are limited in use in that they have a maximum length, and are not suitable for sensitive information as they are plainly visible in the URL."
