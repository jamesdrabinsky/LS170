    "At the implementation level, sockets are a programming interface consisting of a combination of an IP address and a port number that allows for end-to-end communication between processes over a network.  The difference between a connection-oriented and a connectionless system is how the host machine handles the PDU it receives through the use of sockets.\n",
    "\n",
    "A connection-oriented protocol, such as TCP, does not start sending application data until a connection has been established between processes.  The host machine has a socket object listening for messages sent to that specific IP address/ port number pair. When it receives a message, it looks at the source IP address and source port number, and creates a new socket dedicated to listening to messages containing that specific \"four-tuple\" (source and destination IP address and port number). This new socket object establishes a dedicated virtual connection between two processes running on separate hosts.  Further messages with a matching four-tuple are sent to and handled by that socket object.  The advantage of having this dedicated connection is that it allows you to implement rules for managingig communication such as in-order delivery, message acknowledgements and retransmission of messages that weren't received etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a connectionless system, such as UDP, does not establish a connection between processes before transmission.  The host will have a single socket object listening for messages sent to that specific destination IP address / destination port number pair.  It relies on that single object for all communication and receives the messages as they arrive and sends responses as appropriate.  The advantages of a connectionless system include low latency overhead because it does not require setting up and maintaining a connect before data transfer, and flexibility because applications can send data to any endpoint on the network without having to set up a dedicated communication channel.  The disadvantage of a connectionless system is that it doesn't provide the reliability features that a connection-oriented system does.  Because they don't establish a connection between two processes before any data is exchanged they can't implement the in-order delivery, message acknowledgement and retransmission features because there is no message sequencing."

Flow control is a technique used to regulate the data transmission between two devices and prevent the sender from overwhelming the receiver with too much data at once.

    "TCP and UDP are two of the most commonly used transport layer protocols in network communication.  \n",

    "Similarities:\n",
    "- They both enable end-to-end communications between processes on different hosts.\n",
    "- They both use port numners to identify the application.  \n",
    "- They both provide error detection through the use of the chekcsum field in their header. (error detection for UDP is optional in IPv4.\n",
    "- They both provide multiplexing and demultiplexing\n",
    "    \n",
    "Differences:\n",
    "- UDP is a connectionless protocol, while TCP is a connection-oriented protocol. This means that UDP does not establish a connection before transmitting data, while TCP establishes a reliable connection before transmitting data.\n",
    "- TCP provides reliability features such as in-order delivery, message ackowledgement and retransmission and UDP does not. \n",
    "- TCP provides flow control and congestion avoidance and UDP does not.\n",
    "- UDP datagrams can be lost or delivered out of order, while TCP guarantees in-order delivery of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "TCP Pros and Cons:\n",
    "- TCP provides reliable delivery of data\n",
    "- It can adjust its sending rate based on network conditions to avoid congestion and ensure reliable data transmission.\n",
    "- It is well-suited for applications that require reliable data transmission, such as email and file transfer, processing credit card payments, loading web pages etc.<br><br>\n",
    "- TCP introduces latency overhead due to the need of establishing a connection with the three-way handshake, which can up to two round trip times of latency.\n",
    "- TCP can cause head-of-line block due to the in-order delivery of segments which can potentially lead to increased queuing delay and reduced throughput for the connection.\n",
    "    \n",
    "UDP Pros and Cons:\n",
    "- UDP is faster than TCP because its connectionless and doesn't need to establish a connection before it starts sending data.  \n",
    "- Its lack of in-order delvery means no latency due to Head-of-Line blocking, and the one way data flow (there are no acknowledgments) of a connectionless system cuts down on latency due to extra round trips, and since it is a connectionless protocol, it provides no connection state tracking.\n",
    "- It is well-suited for applications that require low latency and can tolerate some data loss, such as real-time video, audio streaming, online games. (DNS queries are also usually done through UDP because of its faster speed.)\n",
    "- It is simpler and requires less overhead than TCP."

    "An HTTP request is a text-based message sent from the client to the server with the aim of accessing a resource on the server.  Examples of an HTTP request include entering an url in the browser address bar, clicking a link or submitting a form. An HTTP request consists of a request line, headers and an optional body.   The request line contains the HTTP method, the path (including any query parameters) and the HTTP version (as of HTTP 1.0).  The three items in the Request Line are separated by a space. The headers allow the client to send additional information during the HTTP request/response cycle.  The `Host` header has been a requirement since HTTP 1.1. With HTTP 1.1, an empty line separates the Header from the Body.\n",

    "AN HTTP response is a text-based message sent from the server to the client with the aim of responding to the client's request.  It consists of a status line, optional headers and an optional body.  The status line contains a status code, status text and HTTP version.  The three items in the Status Line are separated by a space. HTTP response headers contain additional information about the response. With HTTP/1.1,, an empty line separates and delineates the Header from the Body.  The response body consists of the raw data for the requested resource.  This might be the HTML of the webpage, or the raw data of any files being requested, such as images, videos, or audio files."

This is typically issued by a browser in response to some kind of user action or event (i.e. typing a url into an address bar, clicking a link, submitting a form, etc).  The two required pieces of an HTTP request are the HTTP method and the path.  The `Host` header is also required for HTTP/1.1.

When the browser receives the response, it will process the information and render the resource in a user-friendly manner."

    "One way to mimic a stateful application is to have the server send some form of unique token, called a session id, to the client. Whenver the client makes a request to the server, the client appends this token as part of the request, whcih allows the server to identify the client.  This mechanism of passing a session id back and forth between the client and server creates a sense of persistent connection between requests.\n",

    "Another way to maintain a sense of statefulness is to store small files in the browser, called cookies, that contain the session information.  Session data is generate on the server-side and the session id is sent to the client in the form of a cookie.  The client-side cookie is compared with the server-side session data on each request to identify the current session and unlock the stored session data.\n",
