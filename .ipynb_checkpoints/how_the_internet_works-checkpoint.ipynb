    "    - The sender doesn’t move on to the next 5 segments until it has received an acknowledgment from the receiver for those 5 segments\n",
    "    - If sufficient time has passed and the sender has still not received an acknowledgment back (**Acknowledgement #**) on any segment, the sender actually resends that segment (**retransmission of lost data**)\n",

    "    - With every acknowledgment that it sends back, the receiver uses the **Window Size** to indicate how many segments at a time it is currently capable of receiving. \n",

    "    - Using an algorithm that keeps track of how long it takes to receive acknowledgments back, the sender gets a sense of how congested the network is, and adjusts its sending behavior accordingly. \n",
