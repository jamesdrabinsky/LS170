    "- The Transport layer is the level of the networking model that is concerned with providing end-to-end communications between specific processes.\n",
    "- The two most common protocols that govern this communication are TCP and UDP.\n",
    "- These protocols are able to direct data transfer to a specific process or application on a host because the facilitate multiplexing.\n",
    "- This gives us the ability to transmit multiple signals, each pertaining to a potentially different process or networked application, over the single host-to-host connection provided by IP (The Internet / Network Layer).<br><br>\n",
    "- **Internet Protocol (IP)**: IP and its system of addressing is intended to provide communication between hosts, or devices, but not any more than that.\n",
    "    - In IP packets, the source and destination IP addresses are contained in the packet header and can be used to identify the host machines. This effectively creates a communication channel between hosts.\n",
    "- **Multiplexing**: In the context of a communication network, this is the idea of transmitting multiple signals over a single channel,  such as a single device communicating with the browser, the e-mail client, and streaming Spotify all through the same Network connection.\n",
    "    - Multiplexing is enabled through the use of network ports (port numbers) alongside IP addresses\n",
    "    - This is important because often there are multiple applications running on a single device, and yet IP addresses only provide a single channel.\n",
    "- **Demultiplex**: the reverse process; a process reconverting a signal containing multiple analog or digital signal streams back into the original separate and unrelated signals.\n",
    "- **Port**: an identifier for a specific process running on a host.\n",
    "    - Each specific process is assigned a single port, which can be used to identify that same process running on a different device.\n",
    "    - The source and destination port numbers are included in the Protocol Data Units (PDU) for the transport layer.\n",
    "    - Data from the application layer is encapsulated as the data payload in this PDU, and the source and destination port numbers within the PDU can be used to direct that data to specific processes on a host.\n",
    "    - The entire PDU is then encapsulated as the data payload in an IP packet.\n",
    "    - The IP address and the port number together are what enables end-to-end communication between specific applications on different machines.\n",
    "- **Nestsat**: The netstat utility should return a list of active network connections\n",
    "    - The important thing to notice here is that the Local Address and Foreign Address are combinations of IP address and port number.\n",
    "- **Socket**: An IP address and port number combined define a communication end-point known as a network socket.\n",
    "    - an abstraction for an endpoint used for inter-process communication; a communication end-point defined by an address-port pair.\n",
    "    - The IP address and the port number together allow the protocols operating in the Transport Layer to facilitate data exchange between specific applications running on separate devices across the network.\n",
    "    - The combination of IP address and port number information can be thought of as defining a communication end-point.\n",
    "    - This communication end-point is generally referred to as a socket.\n",
    "    - These sockets allow both IP and the protocol operating at the Transport Layer to transmit data between devices and processes.\n",
    "    - The IP address gets us the correct device on the network and the port number gets us to the correct application on that device.\n",
    "    - This is how we can achieve end-to-end communication between devices.\n",
    "    - One important thing to be clear on though is that there is a distinction between the concept of a network socket and its implementation in code.\n",
    "    - At the implementation level, network sockets can also be socket objects\n",
    "- **Connectionless system**: A connectionless system relies on a single socket for all communication, does not establish dedicated communication channels, and responds to all communications individually as they arrive.\n",
    "    - one socket object defined by the IP address of the host machine and the port assigned to a particular process running on that machine.\n",
    "    - That object could call a `listen()` method which would allow it to wait for incoming messages directed to that particular IP/port pair.\n",
    "    - It would simply process any incoming messages as they arrived and send any responses as necessary.\n",
    "    - It does not matter from what process transmissions come, a single socket listens to all messages regardless and responds to each as it arrives.\n",
    "    - This is useful because it is a) a simpler and more flexible process than a connection-oriented system and b) it reduces latency overhead because a connection does not have to be established.\n",
    "- **Connection-oriented system**:  instantiates new socket object to establish a dedicated virtual connection channel between two processes running on separate devices.\n",
    "    - doesn't start sending application data until a connection has been established between application processes\n",
    "    - When new communication comes into the first listening socket, a new socket is created that listens specifically for messages that match its four-tuple, i.e. the IP and port of sender along with the IP and port of the receiver.\n",
    "    - You could have a socket object defined by the host IP and process port, just as in the connectionless system, also using a listen() method to wait for incoming messages\n",
    "    - The difference in implementation would be in what happens when a message arrives.\n",
    "    - At this point we could instantiate a new socket object; this new socket object wouldn't just be defined by the local IP and port number, but also by the IP and port of the process/host which sent the message.\n",
    "    - This new socket object would then listen specifically for messages where all four pieces of information matched (source port, source IP, destination port, destination IP). The combination of these four pieces of information is commonly referred to as a **four-tuple**.\n",
    "    - The advantage of having a dedicated connection like this is that it more easily allows you to put in place rules for managing the communication such as the order of messages, acknowledgements that messages had been received, retransmission of messages that weren't received, and so on.\n",
    "    - The purpose of these types of additional communication rules is to add more **reliability to the communication**.\n",
    "- **Network reliability**: Network Reliability ensures that a reliable communication channel is established between processes.\n",
    "    - That is, that all transmitted data is received at communication end-point in the correct order.\n",
    "    - Consists of 4 key elements:\n",
    "        - **In-order delivery**: data is received in the order that it was sent\n",
    "        - **Error detection**: corrupt data is identified using a checksum\n",
    "        - **Handling data loss**: missing data is retransmitted based on acknowledgements and timeouts\n",
    "        - **Handling duplication**: duplicate data is eliminated through the use of sequence numbers\n",
    "    - Network reliability is implemented by TCP in the Transport Layer.\n",
    "    - Lower level protocols are inherently unreliable, because they drop corrupted data with no protocols for replacement or retrieval.\n",
    "- **Pipelining**: Sending multiple messages at once, without waiting for an acknowledgement.\n",
    "    - This is necessary because if each data transmission must stop and wait for an acknowledgement too much time is spent waiting for the recipient's acknowledgment, which contributes greatly to latency.\n",
    "    - With both systems (**Go-back-N** and **Selective Repeat**), the sender will implement a **'window'** representing the maximum number of messages that can be in the 'pipeline' at any one time, once it has received the appropriate acknowledgements for the messages in the window, it moves the window on.\n",
    "    - Pipelining transmissions can mitigate the latency added by additional waiting time, specifically with regards to the acknowledgement required in TCP and the three way handshake.\n",
    "    - This ensures that TCP is reliable but also as efficient as possible.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transmission Control Protocol is a protocol that operates within the Transport Later. It provides multiplexing, or end-to-end communication between multiple processes over the single channel provided by IP, via port numbers. It also has features that ensure reliability. It uses a three-way handshake to establish dedicated communication connections and this ensures data integrity, de-duplication, in-order delivery, and retransmission of lost data. The complexity of this process can cause significant latency overhead. To mitigate this and to be as efficient as possible, TCP provides flow control and congestion avoidance.<br><br>\n",
    "- **Unreliable communication channel**: The underlying network is inherently unreliable. If we want reliable data transport we need to implement a system of rules to enable it.\n",
    "- **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**: a connection-oriented protocol. It establishes a connection using the Three-way-handshake\n",
    "    - It is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable data transfer between applications on top of the unreliable channel of the lower-layer protocols.\n",
    "    - It provides both multiplexing services, enabling end-to-end communication between processes, and provides features such as the TCP Handshake process that ensure network reliability.\n",
    "    - It doesn't start sending application data until a connection has been established between application processes.\n",
    "    - TCP provides reliability through data integrity, message acknowledgement and retransmission, and in-order delivery.\n",
    "    - The main downsides of TCP are the latency overhead of establishing a connection, and the potential Head-of-line blocking as a result of in-order delivery.\n",
    "    - TCP provides reliability at the cost of speed (that is, its reliability functions can contribute greatly to latency)\n",
    "    - First, there is added overhead due to the need of establishing a connection with the three-way handshake, which can add up to two round trip times.\n",
    "    - There is also the possibility of additional delays due to Head-of-Line blocking as a result of in-order delivery.\n",
    "    - It's not as flexible as other Transport Layer protocols such as UDP.\n",
    "- **Segments**: the Protocol Data Unit (PDU) of TCP.\n",
    "    - It provides five main services:\n",
    "        - **Multiplexing** through source and destination port numbers\n",
    "        - **Error detection** through a checksum\n",
    "        - **In-order deliver, handling data loss, and handling data duplication** through sequence and acknowledgment numbers\n",
    "        - **Flow control** through window size data\n",
    "        - **Congestion avoidance** through dynamic adjustment of flow according to data loss\n",
    "    - it uses a combination of headers and payload to provide encapsulation of data from the layer above.\n",
    "    - With TCP, the HTTP request is encapsulated into the data payload of a TCP segment.\n",
    "    - This segment contains metadata about the source and destination port numbers that allows it to be routed to the correct process running at the other end.\n",
    "    - Data from the application layer is encapsulated as the data payload in this PDU, and the source and destination port numbers within the PDU can be used to direct that data to specific processes on a host. \n",
    "    - The entire PDU is then encapsulated as the data payload in an IP packet. The IP addresses in the packet header can be used to direct data from one host to another. \n",
    "- **Three-way Handshake**: What TCP uses to establish a connection.  Used for establishing dedicated and reliable connections between processes over the network.\n",
    "    - provides reliability in the form of acknowledging the transmitted message, retransmission of messages that get dropped, and in-order delivery of fragmented data.<br><br>\n",
    "    - First the sender sends a SYN segment, which ostensibly asks if the receiver is ready to receive.\n",
    "    - Upon receipt of the SYN segment, the receiver sends back a SYN ACK segment, indicating that it received the previous message and ensuring its messages are also being received.\n",
    "    - Finally, upon receiving the SYN ACK, the original sender sends an ACK segment, indicating it is also receiving messages from the receiver, and the connection can be (and subsequently is) established.\n",
    "    - This not only ensures a reliable connection between both devices, but synchronizes sequence numbers that will be used during the connection.\n",
    "    - It is this aspect of TCP that enables network reliability, that is, handling data loss through message acknowledgement, and ensuring in order delivery and de-duplication via the synchronized segment numbers.\n",
    "    - This can contribute to the overall latency of the trip, due to its complexity.\n",
    "- **Flow control** is a mechanism to prevent the sender from overwhelming the receiver with too much data at once.\n",
    "    - Provided by TCP, flow control helps to ensure that data is transmitted as efficiently as possible.\n",
    "    - This, in turn, helps to mitigate the increased latency inherent in TCP connections.\n",
    "    - Flow control is used to prevent the sender from overwhelming the receiver with too much data all at once.\n",
    "    - It is implemented via the window field of the TCP segment header.\n",
    "        - The window header contains data sent by the receiver letting the sender know the maximum amount of data it can accept at any given time.\n",
    "        - This number is dynamically generates, and therefore the receiver can lower the amount if the buffer is getting full, and the sender will respond accordingly.s\n",
    "    - Data awaiting processing is stored in a **'buffer'**. The buffer size will depend on the amount of memory allocated according to the configuration of the OS and the physical resources available.\n",
    "- **Congestion Avoidance**: Congestion avoidance is a service provided by TCP that attempts to prevent network congestion, a situation in which more data is being transmitted than there is capacity.\n",
    "    - To implement this, TCP uses data loss as a feedback mechanism to determine how \"congested\" the network is, by tracking how many retransmissions are required.\n",
    "    - A lot of data loss, or a lot of retransmissions, indicates there is more data on the network than there is capacity to process that data.\n",
    "    - TCP will take this as a sign to reduce the size of the transmission window, that is, it will send less data along the given channel.\n",
    "    - This is to make data transmission as efficient as possible to mitigate the latency overhead inherent in TCP connections.\n",
    "- **Network Congestion** is a situation that occurs when there is more data being transmitted on the network than there is network capacity to process and transmit the data.\n",
    "    - TCP actually uses data loss as a feedback mechanism to detect, and avoid, network congestion; if lots of retransmissions are occurring, TCP takes this as a sign that the network is congested and reduces the size of the transmission window.\n",
    "- **Head-of-Line (HOL) blocking**: relates to how issues in delivering or processing one message in a sequence of messages can delay or 'block' the delivery or processing of the subsequent messages in the sequence.\n",
    "    - HOL blocking can occur as a result of the fact that TCP provides for in-order delivery of segments. If one of the segments goes missing and needs to be retransmitted, the segments that come after it in the sequence can't be processed, and need to be buffered until the retransmission has occurred.\n",
    "    - This can lead to increased queuing delay which is one of the elements of latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### User Datagram Protocol (UDP)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Datagram**: the Protocol Data Unit (PDU) of UDP. \n",
    "    - It consists of metadata in the form of headers, and a data payload, which is the encapsulated HTTP request or response from the Application Layer above.\n",
    "    - Its headers contain source port and destination port data, which provides for multiplexing and socket routing, information about the length of the datagram, and a checksum.\n",
    "- **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**: a very simple protocol compared to TCP. It provides multiplexing (through source and destination port numbers.), but no reliability, no in-order delivery, and no congestion or flow control.\n",
    "    - It does provide optional error detection via a checksum.\n",
    "    - It establishes end-to-end connections between processes in the Transport Layer.\n",
    "    - UDP is connectionless, and so doesn't need to establish a connection before it starts sending data\n",
    "    - Although it is unreliable, the advantage of UDP is speed and flexibility.\n",
    "    - Specifically, UDP provides speed because it doesn't take the time to establish a dedicated connection, its lack of in-order delivery means no latency due to Head-of-Line blocking, and the one way data flow of a connectionless system cuts down on latency due to extra round trips (there are no acknowledgments).\n",
    "    - Furthermore, UDP acts as a base that programmers can build upon. The specifics of what type of reliability functions to include are left up to the developer to implement at the Application level.\n",
    "    - UDP does not provide any of the reliability of TCP. It is just as inherently unreliable as the layers below it.\n",
    "    - With UDP there is no guarantee of message delivery, delivery order, congestion avoidance, flow control, or state tracking.\n",
    "    - For example, video calling applications and online games that prioritize speed and low latency/lag over the potential for small amounts of lost data, can utilize UDP."

    "\n",
    "- **World Wide Web**: or web for short, is a service that can be accessed via the internet.\n",
    "    - It is a vast information system comprised of resources which are navigable by means of a URL (Uniform Resource Locator)\n",
    "    - HTTP is the primary means by which applications interact with the resources which make up the web.\n",
    "- **Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)**: was the means by which the resources in this system should be uniformly structured.\n",

    "- **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**: is the set of rules which provide uniformity to the way resources on the web are transferred between applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to HTTP\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HTTP: or Hypertext Transfer Protocol**, is a system of rules, a protocol, that serve as a link between applications and the transfer of hypertext documents.\n",
    "    - Under your browser's hood lies a collection of files -- CSS, HTML, Javascript, videos, images, etc. -- that makes displaying the page possible.\n",
    "    - All these files were sent from a server to your browser, the client, by an application protocol called HTTP.\n",
    "    - HTTP operates at the application layer and is concerned with structuring the messages that are exchanged between applications.\n",
    "    - It is TCP/IP that's doing all the heavy lifting and ensuring that the request/response cycle gets completed between your browser and the server.\n",
    "    - It determines how requests for resources on the web are made, as well as how those requests should be responded to.\n",
    "    - It provides uniformity to the way resources are transferred. In other words, it is an agreed-upon format on how to communicate.\n",
    "    - HTTP is based on the client-server paradigm, in which a client (usually some kind of browser) makes a request through the network for a particular web resource stored on a server.\n",
    "    - The server, then, sends a response to this request that ideally contains the requested resource, or if not, some kind of messaging that explained what happened.\n",
    "        - The server's response provides the client with the requested resource, informs the client that the action requested has been carried out, or else informs the client that an error occured in the process.\n",
    "    - HTTP governs the syntax of these messages, which together consist of the request/response cycle.\n",
    "    - HTTP is a text-based protocol. All requests and responses are made in plain text, which makes it inherently insecure.\n",
    "- **Request response protocol**: HTTP follows a simple model where a client makes a request to a server and waits for a response.\n",
    "- **IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)**: All devices that participate in a network are provided unique labels. \n",
    "    - **Port** numbers add more detail about how to communicate\n",
    "    - An IP Address acts as the identifier for a device or server, which can contain hundreds or thousands of ports, each used for a different communication purpose to that device or server.\n",
    "    - Effective communication begins when each device has a public IP address provided by an Internet Service Provider.\n",
    "- **DNS**: or Domain Name System is a distributed database which translates/maps domain names like `www.google.com` to an IP address (like `123.456.123.456`), so that the IP address can then be used to make a request to the server.\n",
    "    - Once the HTTP request is processed into a data unit, that domain name is handed to one of the DNS servers, whose job it is to map it onto the equivalent IP address\n",
    "    - DNS databases are stored on computers called **DNS servers**.\n",
    "    - DNS consists of a distributed database that lives on a multitude of DNS servers.\n",
    "    - When a domain name is entered into a browser address bar, a DNS request is sent to retrieve the corresponding IP address\n",
    "    - If the DNS server that receives the request does not have the correct domain name, it will route the request up the hierarchical system until it finds it\n",
    "    - Because an IP address is just a series of hard to remember numbers, a domain name allows us to have a human readable/user friendly version of the server location.\n",
    "    - [Typical Interaction with Internet](https://launchschool.com/books/http/read/background#howtheinternetworks)\n",
    "- **Client**: The most common client is an application you interact with on a daily basis called a Web Browser.\n",
    "     - Web browsers are responsible for issuing HTTP requests and processing the HTTP response in a user-friendly manner onto your screen.\n",
    "- **Server**: The content you're requesting is located on a remote computer called a server.\n",
    "    - Servers are nothing more than machines or devices capable of handling inbound requests, and their job is to issue a response back.\n",
    "    - Often, the response they send back contains relevant data as specified in the request.\n",
    "- **Resources**: a generic term for things you interact with on the Internet via a URL.\n",
    "    - This includes images, videos, web pages and other files.\n",
    "    - Resources can also be in the form of software that lets you trade stock or play a video game.\n",
    "- **Stateless**: A protocol is said to be stateless when it's designed in such a way that each request/response pair is completely independent of the previous one.\n",
    "    - HTTP is a stateless protocol, which means that the server does not need to hang on to information, or state, between requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a URL?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **URL or (Universal Resource Locator)**: It is a consistently formatted string that allows us to locate a certain resource on the web.\n",
    "    - A URL is a subset of URI, but the two terms are often used interchangeably.  It helps HTTP figure out how and where to send the request\n",
    "    - It includes the domain of the requested resource, i.e. `www.google.com`. \n",
    "    - It provides us with a systematic means of locating resources that we are requesting (via an HTTP request).\n",
    "    - A URL is like that address or phone number you need in order to visit or communicate with your friend.\n",
    "    - A URL is the most frequently used part of the general concept of a **Uniform Resource Identifier** or **URI**, which specifies how resources are located.\n",
    "    - - URL refers to the subset of URIs that, in addition to identifying a resource, provide a means of locating the resource by describing its primary access mechanism (e.g., its network \"location\").\n",
    "    - A URL is a subset of URI that includes the network location of the resource.\n",
    "    - URL components include the:\n",
    "        - **scheme**: tells the web client how/which protocol to use to access the resource.\n",
    "            - The first part of the URL\n",
    "            - A scheme is different from a protocol, although these terms are sometimes used interchangeably\n",
    "            - It indicates which protocol group should be used, but not the specific version\n",
    "            - Schemes and protocols can be differentiated by their case; the convention is to refer to scheme names in lowercase, e.g. http, and protocol names in uppercase, e.g. HTTP.\n",
    "        - **host (or hostname)**: It tells the client where the resource is hosted or located.\n",
    "            - This is written in the format of a domain name.\n",
    "            - DNS takes this human readable domain and finds the equivalent IP so the request can be routed.\n",
    "            - It is a mandatory component of the URL\n",
    "        - **port**: an identifier for the specific process to which the communication should be routed.\n",
    "            - It is only required if you want to use a port other than the default.  \n",
    "            - The default port is 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS.\n",
    "        - **path**: It shows what local resource is being requested from the host. \n",
    "            - This part of the URL is optional.\n",
    "            -  If the resource in question is a home page, the path might consist of a single forward slash (`/`).\n",
    "            - Historically, the path has indicated specifically where the resource was located on the server, but with the proliferation of dynamically generated content, this no longer always follows the absolute file path of the server.\n",
    "        - **query string/parameters**: passes additional information in the form of specially formatted query parameters to the server.\n",
    "            - made up of query parameters. It is used to send data to the server. This part of the URL is also optional.\n",
    "            - Query strings are used to pass additional data to the server during an HTTP Request. They take the form of **name/value pairs** separated by an`=` sign. Multiple name/value pairs are separated by an `&` sign. The start of the query string is indicated by a `?`.\n",
    "            - Because query strings are passed in through the URL, they are only used in HTTP GET requests.\n",
    "            - Query strings are limited in use in that they have a maximum length, and are not suitable for sensitive information as they are plainly visible in the URL.\n",
    "- **URI or Uniform Resource Identifier**: A URI is an identifier for a particular resource within an information space.\n",
    "    - This refers to any kind of uniform string that identifies a particular resource, such as an ISBN for a publication.\n",
    "    - A URL, unlike a URI, must include some piece of data that allows us to locate the resource in question, while a URI does not have this requirement.\n",
    "    - URL refers to a specific kind of URI in which the formatting has already been determined and it contains the location of a particular resource on the web.\n",
    "    - URL and URI are often used interchangeably but this is inaccurate.\n",
    "- **URL Encoding**: a special technique that replaces characters that aren't allowed in a URL with an ASCII code.\n",
    "    - URLs are designed to accept only certain characters in the standard 128-character ASCII character set.\n",
    "    - URL encoding is used if \n",
    "        - a character has no corresponding character in the original ASCII set assigned to URLs\n",
    "        - is unsafe because it can be misinterpreted or modified by some systems (i.e. `%`, spaces, quotation marks, the `#` character, `<` and `>`, `{` and `}`, `and`, and `~`)\n",
    "        - or the character is reserved for special use within the url. (such a `?` which indicates the beginning of the query string or `&` which separates query parameters.  Also `/`, `:`, `@`)\n",
    "    - URL encoding serves the purpose of replacing these non-conforming characters with a % symbol followed by two hexadecimal digits that represent the equivalent UTF-8 character.\n",
    "    - Only alphanumeric and special characters `$-_.+!'()\"`, and reserved characters when used for their reserved purposes can be used unencoded within a URL.  \n",
    "    - As long as a character is not being used for its reserved purpose, it has to be encoded.\n",
    "    - We need a safe way to represent these characters in a URL because using them literally can \"break\" the URL, in that it will no longer be able to locate the resource in question.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Making HTTP Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "- When a user types a URL into an address bar, such as `www.google.com`, this triggers the client (usually the browser) to send an HTTP request for the resource indicated by the address. HTTP is the protocol functioning at the highest layer, the Application Layer, and it governs the structure of messages exchanged between networked applications. It packages data into a PDU known as a Request or a Response. A Request is sent to a certain server to request a particular resource from the web. This might be a webpage, an image, or video file.<br><br>\n",
    "- **A single HTTP message exchange**: consists of a Request and a Response. \n",
    "    - The exchange generally takes place between a Client and a Server. The client sends a Request to the server and the server sends back a Response.\n",
    "- **HTTP Request**: An HTTP request is a text-based message sent from the client to the server with the aim of accessing a resource on the server.\n",
    "    - Entering something into the browser address bar, clicking a link, submitting a form, or any number of other \"user interaction\" with a resources on the web can instigate the sending on an HTTP request.\n",
    "    - consists of a request line, headers, and an optional body.\n",
    "    - The HTTP request line contains the **method**, **path**, and **version**\n",
    "        - The method indicates what kind of action the request is performing (for example, `GET` or `POST`).\n",
    "        - The path indicates where to find the particular resource locally within the server.\n",
    "        - The version tells us which version of HTTP is being used (i.e. 1.0, 1.1, 2)\n",
    "- **GET requests**: Used to retrieve a resource from the server or clicking on a link\n",
    "    - initiated by clicking a link or via the address bar of a browser.\n",
    "- **POST request**: Used when you want to initiate some action on the server (server side action), or send data to a server.\n",
    "    - Typically from within a browser, you use POST when submitting a form or other information (such as user authentication or form submission)\n",
    "    - Without `POST` requests, we are limited to sending data to the server via query strings\n",
    "    - Using a `POST` request in a form fixes the  problem of exposing credentials in the URL query string.  With a `POST` request, we can send more sensitive data such as a username or password\n",
    "    - `POST` requests also help sidestep the query string size limitation that you have with GET requests. With POST requests, we can send significantly larger forms of information (such as images or videos) to the server.\n",
    "- **HTTP body** - the body contains the data that is being transmitted in an HTTP message and is optional. \n",
    "    - In other words, an HTTP message can be sent with an empty body. When used, the body can contain HTML, images, audio and so on.\n",
    "    - What this looks like depends on the type of request methond sent (i.e. method)\n",
    "    - The body is mainly used with a `POST` request, which is used to send data to the server\n",
    "- **HTTP Headers**: allow the client and the server to send additional information during the HTTP request/response cycle.\n",
    "    - a way to give more information about both the client and the resource that is being requesteds\n",
    "    - Headers are colon-separated name-value pairs that are sent in plain text.\n",
    "    - The host header:\n",
    "        - has bee required since HTTP 1.1\n",
    "        - indicates where the resource in question is located as a server may contain many hosts\n",
    "    - Other headers might include:\n",
    "        - `Accept-Language` fields about what languages are accepted by the client\n",
    "        - `User-Agent` specially formatted string that identifies the client such as a `session id`\n",
    "        - `Cookie` information about cookies that help applications maintain the appearance of state\n",
    "        - `Connection` what type of connection the client prefers (such as `keep-alive`)\n",
    "- **HTTP Response**: are text-based messages sent from the server to the client with the aim of responding to the client's request.\n",
    "    - Raw data returned by the server is called a response.\n",
    "    - They either:\n",
    "        - Provide the client with the resource required\n",
    "        - Inform the client that the action it requested was carried out\n",
    "        - Inform the client that an error occurred in the process\n",
    "    - consists of a status line, optional headers, and an optional body.\n",
    "    - The response/status line contains the status code, status text, and version\n",
    "        - The status code is a three digit number indicating the specific status of the response, i.e. whether or not it was successful\n",
    "        - It is accompanied by the status text that tells the status of the response\n",
    "    - HTTP response headers contain additional information about the response\n",
    "        - `Content-Encoding` information about the type of encoding used on the data\n",
    "        - `Server` the name of the server\n",
    "        - `Location` a new resource location if applicable (Location header), which helps the client redirect to the requested resource if it has been moved\n",
    "        - `Content-Type` the content-type (i.e. text/html), which helps the client correctly render the data in a user friendly way\n",
    "    - The HTTP response body consists of the raw data for the requested resource\n",
    "        - This might be the HTML of the webpage, or the raw data of any files being requested, such as images, videos, or audio files\n",
    "- **Status Codes**: three-digit numbers that are part of the status line in a HTTP Response. They indicate the status of the request. There are various categories of status code.\n",
    "    - They signify the status of the response\n",
    "    - **200 OK**: the request was successfully handled, and the resource has been transmitted.  All 200 level response codes indicate success\n",
    "    - **302 Found**: When your browser sees a response status code of 302, it knows that the resource has been moved, and will automatically follow the new re-routed URL in the `Location` response header.\n",
    "        - All 300 level status codes indicate some kind of redirect status\n",
    "        - When the browser receives the 302 response, it will automatically issue an HTTP request to the updated URL provided in the `Location` header.\n",
    "        - This, ideally, will result in the HTTP 200 OK response so that the browser can render the resource for the user.\n",
    "    - **404 Not Found**: The server returns this status code when the requested resource cannot be found due to a client error with the request\n",
    "        - All 400 level status codes indicate various client errors\n",
    "    - **500 Internal Server Error**: A 500 status code says \"there's something wrong on the server side\".\n",
    "        - Indicates a generic server-side error took place while trying to retrieve the requested resource.\n",
    "        - All 500 level status codes indicate server side errors.\n",
    "- **HTTP Tools**:\n",
    "    - When using an HTTP tool, a new request for redirected resources (i.e. a 302 response) will not be issued automatically, as it is with a browser\n",
    "    - A browser will automatically request all referenced resources (i.e. dependencies) in the raw data of a response, and an HTTP tool will not\n",
    "    - A browser will render the row response data in a user friendly way, and an HTTP tool will not\n",
    "\n",
    "### The HTTP Request Response Cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "- The HTTP request/response cycle is the interaction between client and server in which the client makes a request and the server makes a response.\n",
    "- It begins with the client making an HTTP request.\n",
    "    - For our purposes, this is typically issued by a browser in response to some kind of user action or event (i.e. typing a url into an address bar, clicking a link, submitting a form, etc).\n",
    "    - Two required pieces of data in a HTTP request:\n",
    "        - The method (GET, POST ...)\n",
    "        - The path (/tasks)\n",
    "        - Parameters (optional)\n",
    "        - Headers (optional) **The `Host` header is required for HTTP / 1.1??**\n",
    "        - Body (optional)\n",
    "    - The domain name is just used to determine what server to send the request to, but it's not a part of the request itself.\n",
    "    - The request is sent off to the server by means of the lower layer network protocols.\n",
    "- When the server receives the request, it will analyze it.\n",
    "    - This may include actions like verifying the user's session or loading any necessary data from a database or rendering HTML\n",
    "- Once the server has analysed the request, it will send a response to the client.  This includes:\n",
    "    - Status: A numeric code and a short string of text (ex. 200 OK). Used to signify if the request was successful or not.\n",
    "    - Headers: A collection of metadata about the contents of the response. (ex. Content-Type: text/html).\n",
    "        - Helps the client process the response\n",
    "        - This value tells the browser that once it receives the response it can then be displayed in that format.\n",
    "    - Body: the bulk of the actual raw data being sent.\n",
    "        - In the case of a web page, the body will contain all the HTML code that the browser will use to display the result to the user.\n",
    "- When the browser receives the response, it will process the information within and render the resource in a user-friendly manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stateful Web Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- **State**: A \"stateful\" web application is one that maintains knowledge of past interactions\n",
    "    - This might include keeping track of individual user accounts and maintain a \"logged in\" status accross multiple resource requests and refreshes.\n",
    "    - Stateful apps can also keep track of items a user has placed in an online \"shopping cart\", even over multiple days\n",
    "    - When your e-mail client identifies you by name and displays some kind of customized greeting, this is also an aspect of \"state\"\n",
    "- **Stateless**: HTTP is a stateless protocol. This means that each Request/ Response cycle is independent of Request and Responses that came before or those that come after.\n",
    "    - No information is kept on the server between request/response cycles\n",
    "    - Stateless protocols are resilient, fast, and flexible as the server doesn't have to retain any information between each request/response cycle nor does any part of the system have to perform any clean up.\n",
    "    - However, because of the statelessness of HTTP, it can be very difficult to simulate a stateful experience and make it seem like a persistent connection exists as many modern web apps do.s\n",
    "    - This statelessness is what makes HTTP and the internet so distributed and difficult to control, but it's also the same ephemeral attribute that makes it difficult for web developers to build stateful web applications.\n",
    "- **Statefulness**: can be simulated through techniques which use session IDs, cookies, and AJAX.\n",
    "- **Sessions**: One way to maintain a sense of statefulness is to have the server send some form of a unique token to the client.  Whenever a client makes a request to that server, the client appends this token as part of the request, allowing the server to identify clients.\n",
    "    - we call this unique token that gets passed back and forth the **session identifier**.\n",
    "    - This mechanism of passing a session id back and forth between the client and server creates a sense of persistent connection between requests.\n",
    "    - This can be difficult to maintain because each HTTP request must be analyzed for a session id.\n",
    "    - Furthermore, each session id must be validated and the server must establish procedures for invalid ids\n",
    "    - If a session id is valid, the server needs to store and retrieve data associated with each session id, as well as recreate the state from that data when sending back a response\n",
    "- **Cookie**: are a way for the browser to store data sent from the server that helps maintain the appearance of persistent application state. They work in conjunction with `session id`s.\n",
    "    - a piece of data that's sent from the server and stored in the client (browser) during a request/response cycle  .  It contains information about the session id\n",
    "    - Small files stored in the browser and contain the session information.\n",
    "    - These files are stored even if the browser is closed or shut down, which enables a longer and more consistent appearance of state.\n",
    "    - Session data is generated and stored on the server-side and the session id is sent to the client in the form of a cookie.\n",
    "    - The information stored in cookies is sent with each request to the server, then used to \"unlock\" the correct stored session data\n",
    "    - The client side cookie is compared with the server-side session data on each request to identify the current session.\n",
    "    - This allows the server to recreate the correct state of the application, and the session id to be recognized each time a website is visited, even if some time has passed.\n",
    "- **AJAX or Asynchronous JavaScript and XML**: Its main feature is that it allows browsers to issue requests and process responses without a full page refresh.\n",
    "    - When AJAX is used, all requests sent from the client are performed asynchronously, which just means that the page doesn't refresh.\n",
    "    - Modern web pages tend to be fairly complex, including dynamically generated content as well as many resource dependencies.\n",
    "    - Therefore, it behooves us to have a means of responding to both server data and user actions without having to refresh and reload the whole page.\n",
    "    - AJAX enabled this functionality, allowing the client to send and retrieve information in small pieces that can be used to update the state of an application without refreshing/reloading, making it much easier to maintain state.\n",
    "    - AJAX requests are sent like normal HTTP requests, and the server responds to them with a normal HTTP response.\n",
    "    - Instead of the browser refreshing to process the HTTP response, it will process the response with a callback function, which can update the state of the web app.\n",
    "- **Sending stateful data as query parameters when making a request**: This approach used to be nearly universal, but is mostly gone from all modern web sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security\n",
    "- HTTP is a text based protocol, and all it's requests and responses consist of plain text.  As such, HTTP is inherently insecure. \n",
    "- Attackers can employ techniques like packet sniffing and session hijacking to obtain information and perform malignant acts.\n",
    "- Attackers can employ techniques like packet sniffing and session hijacking to obtain information and perform malignant acts.\n",
    "- Security can be increased by using HTTPS, enforcing Same-origin policy, and using techniques to prevent Session Hijacking and Cross-site Scripting.\n",
    "- Using HTTPS, which utilizes TLS to ensure a secure connection helps with this.\n",
    "- **Secure HTTP, or HTTPS**: With HTTPS every request/response is encrypted before being transported on the network.\n",
    "    - This means if a malicious hacker sniffed out the HTTP traffic, the information would be encrypted and useless.\n",
    "    - HTTPS sends messages through a cryptographic protocol called TLS for encryption.\n",
    "    - A resource that's accessed by HTTPS will start with `https://` instead of `http://`, and usually be displayed with a lock icon in most browsers.\n",
    "- **Same-origin policy**: permits unrestricted interaction between resources originating from the same origin, but restricts certain interactions between resources originating from different origins.\n",
    "    - By **origin**, we mean the combination of the **scheme**, **host**, and **port**.\n",
    "    - Only those resources that share all three aspects are allows to issue requests unrestrictedly.\n",
    "    - This prevents attackers from using session hijacking to access `session id`s or other session information.\n",
    "    - Designing for the same-origin policy can help to mitigate the lack of security in HTTP by restricting interactions between resources.\n",
    "- **Cross-origin resource sharing, or CORS**: CORS is a mechanism that allows interactions that would normally be restricted cross-origin to take place.\n",
    "- **Session Hijacking**: refers to a malignant action in which a hacker utilizes a stolen `session id` to authenticate themselves and share sessions\n",
    "    - when an attacker gets a hold of the session id, both the attacker and the user now share the same session and both can access the web application.\n",
    "    - Because a `session id` is used to identify a user to the server, it can also be used by hackers to pose as the user and get logged in without needing to authenticate with a username and password.\n",
    "    - Countermeasures for Session Hijacking include:\n",
    "        - Resetting sessions. With authentication systems, this means a successful login must render an old `session id` invalid and create a new one.\n",
    "        - Setting an expiration time on sessions gives attackers a narrower window for access to the `session id`.\n",
    "        - Use HTTPS across the entire app to minimize the chance that an attacker can get to the `session id`\n",
    "- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: This type of attack happens when you allow users to input HTML or JavaScript that ends up being displayed by the site directly.\n",
    "    - Websites that allow some kind of input, such as allowing users to enter a comment that will be displayed, must protect against cross site scripting or XSS.\n",
    "    - Because it's just a normal HTML `<textarea>`, users are free to input anything into the form. This means users can add raw HTML and JavaScript into the text area and submit it to the server as well\n",
    "    - If the server side code doesn't do any sanitization of input, the user input will be injected into the page contents, and the browser will interpret the HTML and JavaScript and execute it.\n",
    "    - Potential solutions for cross-site scripting include:\n",
    "        - making sure to always sanitize user input. This is done by eliminating problematic input, such as `<script>` tags, or by disallowing HTML and JavaScript input altogether.\n",
    "        - Escape all user input data when displaying it so that the browser does not interpret it as code.  (To escape a character means to replace an HTML character with a combination of ASCII characters, which tells the client to display that character as is, and to not process it)\n",
    "        - Site's can also choose to only accept a safer form of input, such as Markdown.\n",
    "        \n",
    "## Some Background and Diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HTTP**: the canonical definition is a stateless protocol for how clients communicate with servers.\n",
    "    - A client that issues an HTTP request to the server. The server then processes the request, and sends a response back to the client.\n",
    "    - The 3 primary server-side infrastructure pieces include:\n",
    "        - A **web server**: typically a server that responds to requests for static assets: files, images, css, javascript, etc.\n",
    "        - An **application server**: typically where application or business logic resides, and is where more complicated requests are handled. This is where your server-side code lives when deployed.\n",
    "        - **Data store**: The application server will often consult a persistent **data store**, like a relational database, to retrieve or create data.\n",
    "            -  It can be used to persist our data between stateless request/response cycles. That is, the data doesn't go away after each cycle, but persists inside the data store."

    "- **HTTP**: a text based protocol and underneath everything that happens is just text moving between the client and server.\n",
    "    - A set of rules concerned with the syntax and structure of messages exchanged between applications.\n",
    "    - HTTP Request and Responses involve sending text between the client and server\n",
    "    - In order for the protocol to work, the Request and Response must be structured in such a way that both the client and the server can understand them.\n",
    "    - There have been a number of different versions of HTTP since its inception, and each of those versions have slightly different rules:\n",
    "        - **HTTP/0.9** only requires the method and path in the request line.\n",
    "            - In versions of HTTP subsequent to 0.9, the request line must include the HTTP version\n",
    "        - **HTTP/1.0** includes headers.\n",
    "        - With **HTTP/1.1**, the end of the headers is indicated by an empty line.\n",
    "            - The specification for HTTP 1.1 states: A client MUST send a Host header field in all HTTP/1.1 request messages.\n",
    "- **Headers**: a set of metadata that contains additional information about the response that doesn't actually go in the response body itself.\n",
    "    - A response can have any number of headers and that the headers themselves can contain a wide variety of different values based on what header it is and based on the information that is being passed for the value of the header.\n",
    "- **Content-Type**: name of header that is required most of the time and tells the browser or whatever the client is how to interpret the body of the response. A browser will display the response visually.\n",
    "- **Content-Length**: name of header that can be used to indicate the size of the body. This can help determine where the HTTP message should end.\n",
    "- **4xx level response codes**: indicate an error or issue on the client side, i.e. with the request.\n",
    "    - A 400 error is a general indication that there is a problem with the structure of the request; in other words the server did not understand the request due to its syntax.\n",
    "- **5xx level response codes**: indicate an error or issue on server side. \n",
    "    - ex. the request was valid, and the server was able to understand it, but it replies to the client that it cannot communicate using the version of HTTP that the client wants to use.\n",
    "- **3xx evel response codes**: these don't indicate an error. Instead they are generally used in relation to redirection, and indicate to the client that it must take some additional action in order to complete the request.\n",
    "    - The response might include a `Location` header which tells the client where it can now find the resource it originally requested."

    "- It provides no check for whether or not the source of an HTTP response is trustworthy, nor does it provide a means of determining if the messages are being tampered with in transit.\n",
    "- When thinking about TLS it can be useful to think of it as operating between HTTP and TCP.\n",
    "- Purpose of TLS:\n",
    "    - TLS enables us to provide encryption to the inherently insecure plain text of the HTTP protocol.\n",
    "    - It provides authentication services, checking to see if the source of an HTTP response is trustworthy.\n",
    "    - It also provides a means of ensuring data integrity, that is, determining whether or not HTTP messages have been tampered with.<br><br>\n",
    "- **HTTP Requests and Responses**: are transferred in plain text; as such they are essentially insecure.\n",
    "- **Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol**: adds security to HTTP communications.\n",
    "    - It is is a protocol that utilizes cryptography to provide more secure communications between networked applications.\n",
    "    - It is what provides the security aspect of HTTPS, enabling measures of encryption, authentication, and integrity over the inherently insecure protocol of HTTP.\n",
    "    - TLS operates between HTTP and TCP.\n",
    "- **TLS encryption**: allows us to encode messages so that they can only be read by those with an authorized means of decoding the message\n",
    "    - TLS encryption uses a combination of Symmetric Key Encryption and Asymmetric Key Encryption. Encryption of the initial key exchange is performed asymmetrically, and subsequent communications are symmetrically encrypted.\n",
    "    - This secure channel is established with the TLS handshake, which uses both symmetric and asymmetric key encryption\n",
    "    - It encrypts, which increases security, but adds several round-trips of latency which impacts performance\n",
    "- **Symmetric Key Encryption**: an encrypted communication system in which both the sender and receiver posses a shared encryption key.\n",
    "    - The advantages to this are that it facilitates two-way communication. Both parties can use the shared key to encode, send, and decode messages to and from the other.\n",
    "    - This disadvantage is that a symmetric system relies on the fact that no one else has access to the key in order for it to remain secure.\n",
    "    - This means that it requires a secure way for both parties to exchange keys before symmetric encryption can be established, and this is difficult to do on the web.\n",
    "    - For this reason, it is used in conjunction with asymmetric key encryption, which facilitates a secure exchange of a shared key\n",
    "- **Asymmetric Key Encryption**: an encrypted communications system which uses two distinct keys: a public key and a private key.\n",
    "    - The public key is used to encrypt and send a secure message to the recipient, who holds the private key, which is used to decode the encrypted message.\n",
    "    - This only facilitates one way communication, in which only the party who holds the private key can receive and decode secure communications.\n",
    "    - However, because it works only one way, we can se asymmetric key encryption as a means for hosts to exchange symmetric encryption keys during the TLS handshake process.\n",
    "    - Unlike the symmetric system where the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt messages, in the asymmetric system the keys in the pair are non-identical: the public key is used to encrypt and the private key to decrypt.\n",
    "    - Encryption is primarily intended to work in one direction.  Bob can send Alice messages encrypted with the public key which she can then decrypt with the private one, but they can't be used in the other direction.\n",
    "- **The TLS Handshake**:  a special process that takes place after the TCP Handshake in which the client and the server exchange encryption keys.\n",
    "    - This exchange allows both parties to communicate via encrypted messages, thus giving a security advantage over the inherently insecure messages of HTTP.\n",
    "    - TLS uses a combination of symmetric and asymmetric cryptography.\n",
    "        - The bulk of the message exchange is conducted via symmetric key encryption but the initial symmetric key exchange is conducted using asymmetric key encryption.\n",
    "    - The key points to remember about the TLS Handshake process is that it is used to:\n",
    "        - Agree which version of TLS to be used in establishing a secure connection.\n",
    "        - Agree on the various algorithms that will be included in the cipher suite.\n",
    "        - Enable the exchange of symmetric keys that will be used for message encryption.\n",
    "    - The TLS Handshake must be performed before secure data exchange can begin; it involves several round-trips of latency and therefore has an impact on performance.<br><br>\n",
    "    - How the TLS Handshake is implemented:\n",
    "        - The client sends a message to the server in the form of a `ClientHello`, which includes the maximum version of TLS protocol it supports and a list of available cipher suites.\n",
    "        - The server responds with a `ServerHello`, which contains a decision regarding which TLS version and cipher suite will be used. It also includes the server's certificate and public key. This ends with a `ServerHelloDone` marker.\n",
    "        - Next the client initiates the symmetric key exchange process, using the server's public key for asymmetric key encryption.\n",
    "        - Once the keys have been exchanged, the server sends a ready-to-go message using the symmetric key and secure message exchange commences.<br><br>\n",
    "    - Trade offs:\n",
    "        - Allows us to implement secure message exchange over the inherently insecure text based protocol of HTTP\n",
    "        - Because the TLS handshake is a complex process, it can add two round-trips of latency, this has an impact on speed and performance.\n",
    "- **Cipher**: a cryptographic algorithm; in other words they are sets of steps for performing encryption, decryption, and other related tasks.\n",
    "- **Cipher suite**: the agreed set of algorithms used by the client and server during the secure message exchange for encryption, decryption, and other security tasks.\n",
    "    - In general, we want to have a distinct cipher (algorithm) for each task during secure communication.\n",
    "    - These tasks might be performing the key exchange, symmetric key encryption, and checking message integrity.\n",
    "    - The suite to be used is agreed as part of the TLS Handshake. As part of the `ClientHello` message, the client sends a list of algorithms it supports for each required task, and the server chooses from these according to which algorithms it also supports.\n",
    "- **TLS authentication**:  provides a means of verifying the identity of a participant(s) in a message exchange,  to ensure that party is trustworthy.\n",
    "    - This ensures that the source of an HTTP response is trustworthy, and so the provided resource can be safely processed.\n",
    "    - TLS Authentication is implemented through the use of Digital Certificates, which are signed by a chain of Certificate Authorities.  \n",
    "    - Digital certificates are provided by the server during the TLS handshake.\n",
    "    - The certificate includes a public key, a signature (which consists of data encrypted with the private key), and the original data that was used to create the signature.\n",
    "    - Upon receipt, the receiver decrypts the signature with the public key and checks that it matches against the original data, which tells it that the sender is who it says it is (because it holds the private key).\n",
    "    - The digital certificate the server provides is considered to be trustworthy on the basis of the issuing certificate authority and the chain of trust.\n",
    "    - Certificates are signed by a Certificate Authority, and work on the basis of a Chain of Trust which leads to one of a small group of highly trusted Root CAs.\n",
    "    - The server's certificate is sent during the TLS Handshake process.\n",
    "- **Certificate Authorities**: Certificate Authorities are trustworthy sources that issue certificates used by servers to establish authentication.\n",
    "    - We use certificates provided by these authorities to ensure that the certificate in question is not being faked.\n",
    "    - Certificate authorities exist in a hierarchy known as the \"chain of trust\"\n",
    "    - Within this hierarchy, the certificate for lower level authorities is signed by the CA one level above it\n",
    "    - At the top of the chain there exists a Root CA whose certificate is \"self-signed\"\n",
    "    - These consist of a small group of organizations who have proved their high level trustworthiness through prominence and longevity.\n",
    "- **TLS Integrity**: provides a means of checking whether a message has been altered or interfered with in transit.\n",
    "    - Data that is being exchanged via HTTP is encapsulated within the TLS payload\n",
    "    - Metadata fields such as the Message Authentication Code (MAC) allows us the check to see if the message has been interfered with.\n",
    "    - This is slightly different than a regular checksum, which is only concerned with error detection.\n",
    "    - The sender creates a digest of the data payload with a hashing algorithm (pre-agreed upon in the TLS handshake)\n",
    "    - This data is then encrypted with the symmetric key and sent to the receiver\n",
    "    - The receiver decrypts the data, creates a digest with the same pre-agreed upon hashing algorithm, and checks to see if the two match.\n",
    "- **DTLS**:\n",
    "    - DTLS stands for Datagram Transport Layer Security.\n",
    "    - It is a separate protocol based on TLS that is used with network connections that utilize UDP instead of TCP\n",
    "    - Because TLS is interlinked with TCP and the TCP handshake, separate protocols are needed to meet the security requirements of UDP.\n",
    "- **Message Authentication Code (MAC)**: TLS Integrity is implemented through the use of a Message Authentication Code (MAC).\n",
    "    - The intention of the MAC field in a TLS record is to add a layer of security by providing a means of checking that the message hasn't been altered or tampered with in transit."
