    "**Physical Network**\n",
    "- The Physical layer as the bottommost layer of its model in our networked communications model (OSI model).  \n",
    "- The physical network is the tangible infrastructure that transmits all previous encapsulated data (*from the layers above?*) as bits in the form of the electrical signals, light, and radio waves which carry network communications.\n",
    "- The functionality at this level is essentially concerned with the transfer of bits (binary data) acrosss a physical medium.\n",
    "- The physical limitations of networked communication, latency and bandwidth, all come as a result of unavoidable physical laws that govern this layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Latency**\n",
    "- Latency is a measure of the time it takes for some data to get from one point in a network to another point in a network.\n",
    "- It is a measure of delay. The difference between the start and end point is the delay.\n",
    "- It is determined by real physical laws, such as the distance traveled and the speed of the signal traveling (i.e. speed of light, sound, or electricity).\n",
    "- Latency has four main aspects that occur during each network \"hop\" that data takes during its overall journey through the network:\n",
    "    - Propagation delay: this is the amount of time it takes for a message to travel from the sender to the receiver, and can be calculated as the ratio between distance and speed.\n",
    "    - Transmission delay: the amount of time it takes to push the data onto the \"link\" or \"node\" in the overall network\n",
    "    - Processing delay: Data travelling across the physical network doesn't directly cross from one link to another, but is processed in various ways; amount of time it takes to process the data within one of the \"nodes\" or \"links\" in the overall network.\n",
    "    - Queuing delay: The amount of time the data is waiting in the queue or \"buffer\" to be processed is the queuing delay.\n",
    "- The total latency between two points, such as a client and a server, is the sum of all these delays (usually given in milliseconds (ms)), plus any of the following delays:\n",
    "    - Last-mile latency: a \"slowing down\" that takes place at the network edge, as smaller and more frequent hops take place as data moves lower in the network hierarchy\n",
    "    - Round-trip Time (RTT): the length of time for a signal to be sent, added to the length of time for an acknowledgement or response to be received.\n",
    "        - Latency overhead associated with additional round trips is often a trade off to consider when dealing with the implementation of network reliability in TCP.\n",
    "        \n",
    "**Bandwidth**\n",
    "- Bandwidth is the amount of data that can be sent along the physical structure of the network in a particular unit of time (typically, a second).\n",
    "- It is a measure of capacity.\n",
    "- It is also determined by real physical laws, such as the capacity of the medium down which data is being transported.\n",
    "- Because this is almost never a constant amount, we consider the bandwidth of a connection to be whatever value is the lowest value over the entire connection."
