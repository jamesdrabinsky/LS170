IP addresses are also hierarchical in that their structure allows us to categorize them into search subdivisions (a process referred to as subnetting).

Propogation delay is the amount of time it takes for a message (the first bit) to travel from the sender to the receiver, and can be calculated as the ratio between distance and speed.

    "Asymmetric key encryption is an encrypted communication system which uses two distinct keys: a public key and a private key.  The public key is used to encrypt and send a secure message to the recipient, who holds the private key, which is used to decode the encrypted message.  This only facilitates one way communication, in which only the party who holds the private key can receive and decode secure communications.  Because it works only one way, asymmetric key encryption is used as a means for hosts to exchange symmetric encryption keys during the TLS handshake process. "

    "Certificate Authorities are trustworthy sources that issue certificates used by servers to establish authentication.  We use certificates provided by these authorities to ensure that the certificate in question is not being faked.

    "TLS provides data integrity by checking whether a message has been altered or interfered with in transit.  Data that is being exchanged via HTTP is encapsulated within the TLS record payload and meta data is attached in the form of header and trailer fields.  The Message Authentication Code (MAC) in the TLS record's footer allows us to check to see if the message has been interfered with.  \n",

This digest is included in the MAC field and the MAC field will be appended to the TLS record, which contains the encypted data payload, before its sent to the receiver.  Upon receipt of the TLS record, the receiver will decrpyt the data payload and create a digest of the payload.   If the digest calculated by the receiver matches the digest of the original TLS record's MAC field, the receiver knows that the data has not been tampered with during transmission and that it originated from the expected sender."
