    "- A **Protocol Data Unit (PDU)** is an amount or block of data transferred over a network.\n",

    "    - <mark>**TLS**: record</mark>\n",

    "    - **Internet / Network**: packet\n",

    "- The advantages to this are that it facilitates two-way communication. Both parties can use the shared key to encode, send, and decode messages to and from the other.\n",
    "- The disadvantage is that a symmetric system relies on the fact that no one else has access to the key in order for it to remain secure.\n",
    "- This means that it requires a secure way for both parties to exchange keys before symmetric encryption can be established, and this is difficult to do on the web (can't exchange keys in-person when communicating over a network).\n",
    "- For this reason, it is used in conjunction with asymmetric key encryption, which facilitates a secure exchange of a shared key<br><br>\n",
    "- **Asymmetric Key Encryption**: also known as public key encryption, an encrypted communications system which uses two distinct keys: a public key and a private key.\n",
    "- The public key is used to encrypt and send a secure message to the recipient, who holds the private key, which is used to decode the encrypted message.\n",
    "- This only facilitates one way communication, in which only the party who holds the private key can receive and decode secure communications.\n",
    "- Encryption is primarily intended to work in one direction.  Bob can send Alice messages encrypted with the public key which she can then decrypt with the private one, but they can't be used in the other direction.\n",
    "- However, because it works only one way, we can use asymmetric key encryption as a means for hosts to exchange symmetric encryption keys during the TLS handshake process.\n",
    "- Unlike the symmetric system where the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt messages, in the asymmetric system the keys in the pair are non-identical: the public key is used to encrypt and the private key to decrypt.\n",
    "- Advantage: securely exchange symmetric keys\n",
    "- Drawback: only facilitates one way communication"
